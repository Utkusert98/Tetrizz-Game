# Tetrizz-Game
A simple and fun implementation of the classic Tetris game using JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS. Players can control the falling tetromino shapes by moving them left, right, down, or rotating them. The objective is to fill complete rows, which will be cleared to earn points. The game ends when there is no more space for new shapes to appear.
